I am working under the supervision of [Antoine Deleforge](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/) and [Nancy Bertin](https://team.inria.fr/panama/author/nbertin/) on the thesis: *Hunting Echoes for Auditory Scene Analysis*.

My research interest are:
- Machine Learning:
  - Regression and classification
  - Deep learning
  - Bayesian and Latent variable models
  - Non-negative matrix factorization
- Auditory Scene Analysis:
  - Room Impulse Response and Acoustic Channel Estimation and Simulators
  - *Echo-aware* speech enhancements
  - Room geometry reconstruction
- Audio signal processing and inverse problems
  - Sound source localization and separation
  - De-reverberation
  - Convolutive and probabilistic mixing models
