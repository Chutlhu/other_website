 {It is commonly believed that multipath hurts various audio process-ing algorithms. 
  At odds with this belief, we show that multipath infact helps sound source separation, 
  even with very simple propagation models.
  Unlike most existing methods, we neither ignore theroom impulse responses, nor we attempt to estimate them fully.
  Werather  assume  that  we  know  the  positions  of  a  few  virtual  micro-phones generated 
  by echoes and we show how this gives us enoughspatial diversity to get a performance boost over the anechoic case.
  We show improvements for two standard algorithms—one that usesonly magnitudes of the transfer functions, and one that also uses thephases.
  Concretely, we show that multichannel non-negative matrixfactorization aided with a small number of echoes beats the vanillavariant of the same algorithm, and that with magnitude informationonly, echoes enable separation where it was previously impossible},

  {It is commonly observed that acoustic echoes hurt performance of sound source localization (SSL) methods.
  We introduce the concept of microphone array augmentation with echoes (MIRAGE) and show how estimation of early-echo  characteristics can in fact benefit SSL.
  We propose a learningbased scheme for echo estimation combined with a physicsbased scheme for echo aggregation. 
  In a simple scenario involving 2 microphones close to a reflective surface and one source,
  we show using simulated data that the proposed approach performs similarly to a correlation-based method 
  in azimuth estimation while retrieving elevation as well from 2 microphones only, an impossible task in anechoic settings.},

{Live concert recordings consist in long multitrack audio samples with significant interferences between channels. 
For audio engineering purposes, it is desirable to attenuate those interferences. 
Recently, we proposed an algorithm to this end based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization, 
that iteratively estimate the clean power spectral densities of the sources 
and the strength of each in each microphone signal, encoded in an interference matrix. 
Although it behaves well, this method is too demanding computationally 
for full-length concerts lasting more than one hour. 
In this paper, we show how random projections of the data can be leveraged 
for effective estimation of the parameters. Interference reduction with these ideas 
can be achieved on full-length live multi-track recordings in an acceptable 
time and could be used by sound engineers. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on 
real full-length live recordings from the Montreux Jazz Festival and also provide an implementation of the method.},

abstract = {In live multitrack recordings, each voice is usually captured by dedicated close microphones. Unfortunately, it is also captured in practice by other microphones intended for other sources, leading to so-called "interferences". Reducing this interference is desirable because it opens new perspectives for the engineering of live recordings. Hence, it has been the topic of recent research in audio processing. In this paper, we show how a Gaussian probabilistic framework may be set up for obtaining good isolation of the target sources. Doing so, we extend several state-of-the art methods by fixing some heuristic parts of their algorithms. As we show in a perceptual evaluation on real-world multitrack live recordings, the resulting principled techniques yield improved quality.},
